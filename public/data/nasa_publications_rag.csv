The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.

Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.

Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles.

After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.

Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG-/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated.Conclusions p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway.

Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally characterized. Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants.

Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally, a subset of these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.

These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well.

These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.

This Perspective explores such considerations with respect to space traveler selection and human subject research. It has been over 50 years since the first human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceflights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the definition of commercial spaceflight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts.

Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.

A forward-genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants hypersensitive to latrunculin B identifies HLB1 as a plant-specific protein that functions in post-Golgi traffic. The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN/EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants. Normal plant development relies on the endomembrane system as it plays a central role in directing the delivery of enzyme complexes and polysaccharide precursors to the cell surface and to the vacuole (Kim and Brandizzi, 2014; Kim et al., 2015). In addition, protein traffic through endomembranes is pivotal for specifying how plants respond and adapt to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses (Chen et al., 2008; Lozano‐Durán et al., 2014; Garcia de la Garma et al., 2015). The endomembrane system is highly dynamic and consists of a network of functionally interconnected organelles beginning with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where proteins are synthesized and then trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) and vacuole after processing and sorting in the Golgi apparatus and post-Golgi organelles (Richter et al., 2009; Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013).

Root hairs expand by tip growth, a process that involves the targeted delivery and secretion of vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, root hairs attain lengths that are several times their widths (Chebli et al., 2013). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an assortment of carbohydrate precursors that are needed for the assembly and remodeling of the apical cell wall (Gu and Nielsen, 2013). Research spanning several decades has led to the identification of multiple components of the tip growth machinery including protein modulators of cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) signaling, and phosphoinositide metabolism (Cole and Fowler, 2006; Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013). In recent years, plant malectin-like receptor kinases, also known as Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls; Franck et al., 2018), have been shown to regulate tip growth in root hairs and pollen tubes (Duan et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2017; Schoenaers et al., 2018). In one noteworthy study, Bai et al. (2014) reported that a CrRLK1L, which they named [Ca2+]cyt-associated protein kinase 1 (CAP1), modulates root hair growth by maintaining ammonium (NH4+) homeostasis. CAP1 is also known as ERULUS (ERU), named after the son of FERONIA (FER), a widely studied member of the CrRLK1L family (Haruta et al., 2014). In Arabidopsis thaliana, cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants have short and irregularly shaped root hairs consistent with a role of CAP1/ERU as a positive regulator of root hair growth (Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Schoenaers et al., 2018). Bai et al. (2014) proposed a model wherein CAP1/ERU functions in maintaining root hair growth under high NH4+ environments by sensing cytoplasmic NH4+. Sensing of cytoplasmic NH4+ by CAP1/ERU then triggers signaling events that lead to NH4+ sequestration into the vacuole, making it less toxic to the cell. The model postulates that toxic levels of NH4+ accumulate in the cytoplasm of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants, resulting in the disappearance of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients, and because of this lack of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients, their root hairs cease to expand (Bai et al., 2014). In this letter, we question the proposed role of CAP1/ERU in NH4+ homeostasis based on our studies of a new eru-3 mutant allele, showing that CAP1/ERU is instead localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and its function is linked to tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations. This is further supported by recent work on the eru-2 mutant by Schoenaers et al. (2018), as describe","CAP1/ERU IS A PM-LOCALIZED PROTEIN: A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH4+ homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast.

SPIRRIG and SCAR/WAVE are molecular determinants of actin-mediated root hair development in Arabidopsis. Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234. BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC. Root hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades because they serve as excellent models to unravel mechanisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014).

Detergent-induced rearrangements of membrane-protein subunits explain why two MscL channel stoichiometries have been resolved by X-ray crystallography - but S. aureus MscL is truly a pentamer in vivo. While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C8E5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state.

Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices.

Email: tboothby@gmail.com. Author contributions: T.C.B. and B.G. designed research and wrote the paper. Our report (1) describing the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer in a tardigrade genome has raised questions from other groups who were sequencing the Hypsibius dujardini genome in parallel or who have done new experiments and analyses since our report (2–5). Bemm et al. (2) now report filtering our data for likely contaminants, resulting in a new, prefiltered genome assembly. Arakawa (3) has sequenced genomes of starved, washed, individual animals that had been treated with antibiotics for 48 h, and used this genomic sequence and RNA-Seq data to identify likely bona fide tardigrade contigs. Two other reports have contributed data and analysis: Delmont and Eren (4) used a newly published analysis and visualization platform, Anvi'o (6), to identify likely contaminants in our genome assembly, and Koutsovoulos et al. (5) applied useful taxon-annotated GC coverage plots (Blobplots) (7) to our data and reported an independent genome assembly. Before discussing the robustness of our finding of extensive horizontal gene transfer in tardigrades, we first note that we mistakenly uploaded an outdated version of our assembly to public databases. This assembly was 252 Mb, larger than the 212.3-Mb assembly that we had used in our report (1), as pointed out correctly by others (5). The 212.3-Mb assembly used in our report is available at the link provided below. The originally uploaded 252-Mb assembly includes ∼40 Mb of sequence that we had identified as microbial contamination (see methods detailed at https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response). This mistake may have contributed to discrepancies and issues raised by others. For example, Bemm et al. (2) identified 39 Mb of untrusted assembly, similar to the ∼40 Mb we filtered. Similarly, Delmont and Eren (4) identified whole bacterial genomes in our 252-Mb assembly, which were already largely filtered out in our 212.3-Mb assembly. We apologize to other groups for this mistake. A central finding of our original report (1) is a high rate of foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome, which has been argued by others (2–5) to be an artifact of incomplete filtering of contaminating microbial sequences. The availability of these other groups' independent assemblies and multiple filtering approaches [via k-mer selection (2) or GC% and coverage (5)] allows us to test the robustness of our conclusions. Because any metric used will have its own particular strengths and weaknesses, we used three different approaches: (i) employing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) index (8), (ii) identifying genes that align to prokaryotic but not eukaryotic sequences, and (iii) identifying a base level of HGT, i.e., “class C” genes as defined by Crisp et al. (9). Using the HGT index, we find that 3.8–7.1% of genes in these independent H. dujardini assemblies appear foreign (F",,2025-10-03,success

If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.

A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway. The secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is responsible for biogenesis and proper intracellular distribution of a wide range of proteins, complex carbohydrates and lipids. Trafficking in the secretory pathway is highly dynamic and responsive to specific cellular functional demands. Forward transport (also known as anterograde transport) of newly synthesized proteins and lipids is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, ER-to-Golgi transport represents a vital gateway to the endomembrane system. Membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi is bidirectional and occurs via similar mechanisms. In both cases, a carrier forms on the donor organelle and then tethers to and fuses with the target organelle (FIG. 1). Distinct machineries facilitate the formation of carriers for anterograde and retrograde transport, which are thought to ensure fidelity and directionality of trafficking: coat protein complex II (COPII) operates in the anterograde pathway from the ER, and COPI functions in the retrograde route from the Golgi.

Keywords: unfolded protein response, ER stress, IRE1, cell fate, protein quality control, membrane trafficking system The membrane trafficking system maintains operation of approximately one-third of the eukaryotic proteome. Most secretory proteins first enter the ER for folding and assembly. To maintain the fidelity of ER functions, cells coordinate a protein quality control system with a signaling network termed unfolded protein response (UPR) [1-6]. UPR is triggered by ER transmembrane sensors upon ER stress, a cellular condition referring to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (Figure 1) [7, 8]. The adaptive response occurring at the initial phase of UPR aims to rebalance the protein-folding homeostasis [2, 3, 9-12]. If cells fail to recover from ER stress, UPR represses the adaptive response and triggers apoptosis [1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14]. The inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1) is the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast and essential for UPR in animals and plants [15-18] (Figure 1). As an ER transmembrane protein, IRE1 monitors ER homeostasis through an ER luminal stress-sensing domain and triggers UPR through a cytoplasmic kinase domain and an RNase domain [15, 16]. Upon ER stress, IRE1 RNase is activated through conformational change, autophosphorylation, and higher order oligomerization [19-21].

Depleting galactose from the cell wall polysaccharide xyloglucan leads to a disruption of diverse cellular and physiological processes involved in normal plant growth. Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating mur3 mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating mur3 mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 (XLT2) gene. Normal growth was restored in the mur3-3 mutant overexpressing XLT2 and in mur3-3 xxt double mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes. There have been considerable advances in understanding how changes in specific amino acids or nucleotides affect the ability of a protein or an RNA to fold and to function (Wan et al., 2011; Sauer, 2013). By contrast, much less is known about how polysaccharide structure and function are affected by altering specific monosaccharides within its glycosyl sequence.

Corresponding author: Brandizzi, Federica (fb@msu.edu) To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management. In growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential lipids, and assembles complex-protein associated carbohydrates. When the cell's biosynthetic demands overcome the ER biosynthetic capacity, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is initiated. In multicellular eukaryotes if the UPR fails, ER stress-induced apoptosis occurs. Along eukaryotic lineages, specialized sensors have evolved to manage the UPR and control life-or-death outcomes in ER-stress conditions [1,2]. For ER-stress protection, yeast relies exclusively on the ER-associated ribonuclease and kinase IRE1. Plants and metazoans have evolved a complex signaling network based on membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) (Box 1), some of which are plant-specific (Figure 1). In metazoans, the ER-associated PERK also operates in UPR signaling (Box 1). Although PERK-like activity has been detected is plants [3], plant PERK-like proteins have not been identified yet (Box 1). In response to ER stress in metazoans, the ER membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) moves to the Golgi where the site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P, S2P) release the TF domain from the membrane anchor. This process is followed by nuclear translocation of the TF domain to modulate gene transcription. The Arabidopsis genome encodes functional homologs of ATF6: AtbZIP28 [44,45] and AtbZIP17 [40]. Functional equivalent TFs have been reported in other plant species [7,46]. The mechanisms of activation of AtbZIP28 are similar to those of ATF6 with COPII-dependent ER-to-Golgi translocation [47] and subsequent activation through proteolysis at the Golgi by S1P [48] and","Abstract: To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded p | Introduction: In growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential li | Membrane-tethered bZIP TFs: In response to ER stress in metazoans, the ER membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) moves to the Golgi where the site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P, S2P) release the TF domain from  | Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: activation of a transcription factor: Plants encode one or more IRE1 isoforms (Figure 1a).

Address correspondence to david.robinson@urz.uni-heidelberg.de. Received 2015 Jan 25; Accepted 2015 Apr 16; Issue date 2015 Jun. Four leading cell biologists reflect on the controversial nature of the vector for transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus in higher plants. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast. Cell biology textbooks usually give a description of the Golgi apparatus as it is seen and functions in a mammalian cell. This is understandable considering the huge body of literature on this organelle in animal cells, especially in relation to disease. It also reflects and is designed to accommodate the large readership from the medical sciences.

High levels of methylesterification of pectin allow for enhanced cell expansion, partitioning of resources to leaf growth, and increased leaf area for photosynthesis, which in turn enhance plant growth. Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related (CGR) 2 or 3 genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO2 diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR-mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, CGR-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area. Photosynthesis is the major source of carbon (C) for plant growth. How","Abstract: Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves.

Keywords: Microbiome, Mars, Space science, Astronaut health, 16S rRNA gene Maintaining astronaut health throughout long-duration spaceflight is essential to the feasibility of a manned mission to Mars. The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration spaceflight. The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap [1] outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030.

Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine.Conclusions Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-024-02374-2.Keywords: African swine fever virus, Antiviral, Anti-inflammatory, Cytokine production, Screening Received 2024 Jan 18; Accepted 2024 Apr 21; Collection date 2024.

Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage.

Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host’s ability to fight pathogens. CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues. Abs are heterodimers composed of H and L chains (1). The rearrangements of three different gene segments, the variable (V) gene segment, the diversity (D) gene segment (H chain only), and the joining (J) gene segment forms the variable regions of the Ab (1, 2). Abs play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response, protecting the host from a variety of challenges.

As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a ΔmotABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested.Conclusions These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.Keywords: Spaceflight, Microgravity, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flow cytometry, Motility Received 2013 Jun 4; Accepted 2013 Oct 15; Collection date 2013.

With precious few spaceflight missions, all space-related biological and biomedical-health data are priceless national resources that anyone should be able to easily access. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) plays a crucial role in ensuring such accessibility, housing comprehensive space-related datasets derived not only from various model organisms but also from non-NASA human astronauts1. These datasets cover a wide spectrum of biological assays conducted at multiple levels, ranging across cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms. They effectively capture diverse types of data, including ‘omics, phenotypic, physiological, and behavioral changes experienced in space2,3. Additionally, OSDR enriches this data by providing metadata contextualizing each experiment including the associated experimental hardware and environmental telemetry. OSDR has worked with a large and open scientific community to standardize data generation and formatting, enabling advanced analytics, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis. With the support of NASA’s scientific leadership, the spirit of Open Science has permeated every scientific division at NASA, including the Biological and Physical Science (BPS) Division. The BPS Division has emerged as a pivotal force in fueling humanity’s fascination with space exploration by understanding the mechanisms of life adapting to extreme environmental hazards of deep space4. As NASA launched the ambitious ""Transform to Open Science"" program (TOPS)5 in 2023, it aims to accelerate the adoption of a more reproducible and transparent approach to research. TOPS also aims to train 20,000 scientists in the art of Open Science by 2028 (https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), pushing for better equity and inclusivity in science.

Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min−1·100−1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min−1·100−1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.

Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. These findings suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM.

Conclusion: HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.

Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule.

The text and caption for the entire figure discuss transferrin (Tf) and the correct graph is pasted below. Views of GC-OLPs (A–C) or SPC-OLPs (D–F) two weeks after being seeded. (A) Most GC-OLPs expressed Tf in their cytoplasm (inset and arrow). (B) They also co-expressed GPDH. (C) Merged view of both markers that colocalized. (D) Tf was expressed by all cells in their nuclei rather than the cytoplasm. (E) Most of these cells were weakly labeled for GPDH, and only those that had undergone karyokinesis or in the process of cytokinesis displayed nuclear GPDH expression. (F) Merged view of both markers. (G) This bar graph shows the percentage of the markers expressed alone or co-expressed by OLPs. In the GC group, 34% co-expressed both OL markers. Only 51% expressed transferrin alone, and 41% expressed GPDH only. In the case of SPC-OLPs, only 58% co-expressed Tf in the nucleus and cytoplasmic GPDH, although the GPDH expression was faint and it colocalized in the nucleus only in cells that had undergone karyokinesis and those that appeared to be undergoing cytokinesis. Only 2.2% of these OLPs expressed GPDH alone, indicative of their immature stage with respect to GC cells. The data are shown both in cell numbers and percentages. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (p < 0.01). An orthogonal image of the localization of Tf is shown in Supplemental Figure S4. The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected.

The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.

The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.

In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.

We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

Keywords: Ca2+ signaling, Yellow Cameleon, Two Pore Channel 1 Their sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca2+ waves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 µm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis thaliana root, Ca2+ wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca2+ wave/TPC1 system likely elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance.

The highly restricted movement of amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells of zig-1 hypocotyls is overcome by wortmannin treatment, suggesting a physical association between amyloplasts and the vacuole. Key words: Amyloplasts, cytoskeleton, gravitropism, SNARE, vacuole, wortmannin. Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1, suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception. Plants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots (Hashiguchi et al., 2013). Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing (Masson et al., 2002). Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes","Highlight: The highly restricted movement of amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells of zig-1 hypocotyls is overcome by wortmannin treatment, suggesting a physical association between amyloplasts and the vacuole. | Abstract: Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin.

Received 2016 Feb 9; Accepted 2016 Jun 2; Issue date 2016 Jul. Mathematical modeling coupled with direct measurement of Ca2+ and ROS dynamics suggest that ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release propagates stress-induced Ca2+ waves in plants. Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca2+ wave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca2+ wave originating from Ca2+ release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We conclude that a Ca2+ diffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS-triggered element, however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca2+ wave propagation in the Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (AtrbohD) knockout background all led to reductions in Ca2+ wave transmission speeds consistent with this model. Furthermore, imaging of extracellular ROS production revealed a systemic spread of ROS release that is dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1. These results suggest that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism intimately involving ROS production by AtRBOHD and Ca2+ release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1.

Received 2020 Jun 11; Revised 2020 Aug 26; Accepted 2020 Sep 11; Issue date 2020 Nov. The reactive oxygen species wave propagates through vascular bundles during the systemic response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants to excess light stress. Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These studies further identified the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles. Plants and other multicellular organisms are able to transmit different chemical and physical signals over long distances, sometimes traversing their entire length. These signals coordinate the response of the entire organism to different stresses, pathogens, and/or other stimuli and are thought to play a key role in the acclimation, defense, and adaptation of different organisms to their environment (Choi et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2018; Kollist et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In plants, a plethora of chemical and physical signals are transmitted from a single leaf or root tip subjected to stress (i.e., a local tissue) to the entire plant (i.e., systemic tissues). These signals, collectively termed systemic signals, include different chemicals and volatiles, such as salicylic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate, as well as small peptides, and physical signals such as electric signals and hydraulic waves (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Szechyńska-Hebda et al., 2010; Devireddy et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Takahashi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).

The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.

To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls).

To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.

RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH).Results Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months.Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C.

HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.

A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.

The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content.

We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.

Hemodynamic changes were monitored by clinical parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and ST segment of ECG.Results There were no statistically-significant differences in surgical field clarity grade (P = .577) and tympanic membrane flap flipping time (P = .490) among 4 concentration groups. Epinephrine injection did cause an increase in hemodynamic parameters when compared with baseline (P < .05). Compared with the relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the relatively-higher concentration groups (1:5000 and 1:10,000) had more significant and long-lasting effect until 30 minutes after injection.Conclusions and relevance Four concentration groups of topical epinephrine injection in otoendoscopic surgery have the same effect on surgical field clarity.

Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t tests and regression analyses.RESULTS: Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%–9% for CSA in both muscles.

Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.

Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response. CA, KP, IS and LH (guarantor) performed experiments. MC, MB and EKF performed the bioinformatic analyses on the RNA-Seq data to obtain the FPKMs for each gene and to determine the statistically significant transcript changes between LSMMG and NG samples. LH assigned the genes to functions and/or pathways and performed the GeneSifter analyses. RSS advised on the gene expression studies and DGE advised on M. marinum culture. RS graphed the violin plots (Figure 2) and performed the statistical analyses for the growth and survival studies. LH directed and supervised the experiments and prepared the manuscript.

After six months it is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution–Noncommercial–Share Alike 3.0 Unported license, as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). Cell viability and metabolism depend on cytoplasmic water and solute content, and organisms have evolved mechanisms to sense changes in cell water content, solute concentrations, cell volume, and/or turgor. This Perspective addresses the response to osmotic challenge in land plants and describes their special dependence on cellular water status for growth and development. Understanding how plants cope with water limitation may allow us to mitigate the agricultural effects of drought, a critical limitation on global crop productivity that is likely to increase in severity as the climate changes (Long and Ort, 2010). The signaling pathways by which plants respond to osmotic challenge are intriguing from an evolutionary standpoint: some aspects of these pathways resemble those of fungal or mammalian cells, some are similar to prokaryotic mechanisms, and yet others are unique to plants (as described below and in Hamann, 2012). In addition to the importance of osmotic homeostasis in land plants, we will discuss some of the specific context and language of plant stress biology, and describe what is known (and not known) about the molecular pathways by which plants sense and respond to osmotic challenges. Plants can only take up water from the soil in which they are growing, and are unable to relocate to find more favorable water conditions. The majority of the water extracted from the soil by a plant’s roots travels rapidly up the plant through the vascular system, eventually to be lost via regulated pores in the leaf epidermis called stomata. This vertical movement of water within the plant mediates the root-to-shoot movement of nutrients, hormones, and developmental signals. Importantly, open stomata are also the conduits through which gas is exchanged between the leaf and the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Thus, plants must continuously balance the advantages of efficient photosynthesis and solute transport with the drawbacks of water loss through open stomata; how well they accomplish this task contributes to their water use efficiency, a key factor in drought response (Long and Ort, 2010). At the cellular level, water is critical for maintaining and controlling an important driving force in plant cells called turgor pressure. Much of a plant cell’s water—and therefore most of its volume—is accounted for by the vacuole (a large intracellular organelle found in plants, fungi, and animals).

KEY WORDS: Arabidopsis thaliana, Cytokinin, Plastid, Reactive oxygen species, Retrograde signaling, Shoot apical meristem The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.

Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta.

G. Wells (First Men on the Moon, 1901; Fig. 2) were the starting point of science fiction and the dream of space exploration. Verne proposed a “projectile bullet capsule” shot from a long cannon named Columbiad as a means for 3 explorers to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave Earth's gravity (1). Even in 1865 there were concerns about humans' ability to survive extreme velocities. Verne made crude calculations on the length of cannon needed for a human to survive a launch to the moon. Almost 100 yrs later, the United States used a very similarly shaped Apollo capsule named Columbia to take 3 astronauts—Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin—to the moon and return to Earth. Jules Verne's “bullet capsule,” designed to take 3 explorers to the moon by being shot from a very long gun barrel.

G. Wells, first published in 1901. Image courtesy Airmant Publishing Co., Inc. The vision of spaceflight began with science fiction literature, which was followed decades later by the science, engineering and other technological achievements that made it a reality. It took the momentum of war to further advance technology to a point where space travel was possible. After World War II, the United States and the USSR repurposed the spoils of war, transforming the once terrorizing German V-2 rocket program into new space programs. Some vehicles are specifically designed for suborbital (ballistic) flight; examples include crewed vehicles, such as the X-15 rocket plane, sounding rockets, and Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, and uncrewed rockets, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The first spaceflight was ballistic and reached an altitude of 17 nautical miles (31.5 km) above the earth. Ballistic flights, by definition, do not go into orbit and have only brief periods of microgravity (10−3 to 10−6 g). During ballistic flights, spaceflight microgravity lasts from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours before returning to the planet. This type of flight only offers short opportunities for scientific query. Orbital flights travel at ∼17,500 nautical miles per hour (∼32,400 km/h) around the planet and are on a different scale of experimental time since microgravity can last from days, weeks, and months to years. Orbital flights support a wide range of science investigations from signal transduction and gene expression to differentiation, physiology, and development.

We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.

Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions.

Fungi are potential sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds during long-term spaceflight but also could affect astronaut health through both opportunistic infections and system biofouling (1, 2). As part of a study characterizing fungal responses to the space environment, we report the draft genomes of 94 fungal strains that were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), representing 10 ascomycetous and 1 basidiomycetous species. Aspergillus species are environmental fungi and opportunistic pathogens (3). Aspergillus unguis is a member of the ISS microbiome (4) and produces industrially important compounds (5). Aureobasidium pullulans is a black fungus that was previously isolated from the ISS water filtration system (6) and Mars mission spacecraft-associated surfaces (7). Cladosporium species are dominant fungal contaminants in indoor air (8, 9). Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladosporium cladosporioides were detected multiple time on the ISS, and their properties in microgravity were studied (10, 11).

The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.

Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.

However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, low-g level (< 0.1g) or the Moon g-level with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.

APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018.

Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.

The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.

Modulation of arogenate dehydratase in Arabidopsis causes changes in secondary metabolism, transient overaccumulation of starch, and lower photosynthetic electron transport rates. Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulate","Abstract: Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis.

There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals.

RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress.

RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.

Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs).

The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.

As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes.

The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.

How the polyamine cadaverine alters plant development is poorly understood. Here it is shown that natural variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine. Key words: Arabidopsis, cadaverine, natural variation, polyamines, roots, transporter. Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg erecta (Ler) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) is at least partially responsible for this difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in Ler, and oct1 mutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or Ler, the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions. Polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species including Arabidopsis thaliana (Shevyakova et al., 2001; Knott et al., 2007). Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins (Bagni and Tassoni, 2001). Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules ","Highlight: How the polyamine cadaverine alters plant development is poorly understood.

In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.

Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.

Muday (muday@wfu.edu). Received 2013 Dec 4; Accepted 2014 Mar 2; Issue date 2014 Apr. In the epidermis of Arabidopsis leaves, flavonols specifically accumulate in guard cells with enhanced synthesis in the presence of ethylene, where they lower the levels of reactive oxygen species and reduce the rate of stomatal closure. Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonol-specific dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-specific flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no flavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal closure. These results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses. Guard cells use an extensive signal transduction pathway to regulate the aperture of stomata, pores on the surface of leaves that facilitate gas exchange and water loss (Roelfsema and Hedrich, 2005; Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). CO2, a necessary reactant for photosynthesis, enters leaves through stomata, whereas water can leave through these same pores via transpiration.

Fundamental mechanisms associated with gravitropism in woody stems of Populus involve relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter and interacting roles for auxin, gibberellic acid, and the ARBORKNOX2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending. Angiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in Populus trees, that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-specific expression of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile fibers, and gibberellic acid (GA) stimulation of tension wood formation are all sensitive to transcript levels of the Class I KNOX homeodomain transcription factor-encoding gene ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2). We generated genome-wide transcriptomes for trees in which gene expression was perturbed by gravistimulation, GA treatment, and modulation of ARK2 expression. These data were employed in computational analyses to model the transcriptional networks underlying wood formation, including identification and dissection of gene coexpression modules associated with wood phenotypes, GA response, and ARK2 binding to genes within modules. We propose a model for gravitropism in the woody stem in which the peripheral location of PIN3-expressing cells relative to the cambium results in auxin transport toward the cambium in the top of the stem, triggering tension wood formation, while transport away from the cambium in the bottom of the stem triggers opposite wood formation. Gravity is a universal input that modulates plant growth and development, and various plant lineages and organs have evolved mechanisms to regulate growth and orientation relative to the force of gravity. Much of what is known about plant responses to gravity comes from studies of herbaceous annual plants wherein gravitropic responses rely on differential elongation. By contrast, lignified woody stems can no longer undergo elongation, necessitating a different solution.

Recently it was reported that Carnobacterium sp. strain WN1359, isolated from Siberian permafrost, was capable of growth under a combination of low-temperature (0°C), low-pressure (0.7-kPa), and CO2-enriched anoxic conditions intended to simulate the atmosphere of Mars (1). Based upon cladistic and phenetic analyses, the name C. gilichinskyi sp. nov. was proposed, with strain WN1359 being the type strain (W. L. Nicholson, K. Zhalnina, R. R. Oliveira, and E. W. Triplett, submitted for publication). As part of an effort to further investigate the molecular basis of the response of this organism to simulated Martian conditions, we report here the complete genome sequence of the strain. C. gilichinskyi strain WN1359 is from the corresponding author’s strain collection and is deposited as strain DSM 27470T in the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) (http://www.dsmz.de). Its genome was sequenced at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR) using the PacBio SMRT system (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). A total of 78,692 reads were obtained, with a mean read length of 3,850 bp. The initial PacBio reads were error corrected using the PacBio RS_PreAssembler.1 module with minimum subread length of 500 bp, minimum read quality of 0.80, and minimum seed read length of 6,000 bp. The error correction process yielded 10,736 reads with an average length of 6,421 bp. A single scaffold was assembled directly from the error-corrected reads using Celera assembler (CA) version 7.0 software. The initial genome assembly was further refined using the PacBio RS_Resequencing.1 module with Quiver consensus calling. This process removes sequencing errors remaining in the initial CA assembly and produces the final consensus genome sequence. The chromosome has 2,347,813 bp and an overall GC content of 35.26%. We detected the presence of five plasmids in the genome, consisting of 9,615 bp (designated pWNCR9), 12,656 bp (pWNCR12), 15,476 bp (pWNCR15), 47,068 bp (pWNCR47), and 64,492 bp (pWNCR64).

IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.

An in vitro model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 model does not support NV replication. Norovirus (NoV) has been identified as the primary etiologic agent of acute epidemic viral gastroenteritis in industrialized countries (1,2). Norwalk virus (NV) is the human prototype GI.1 NoV strain; it belongs to the Caliciviridae family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped viruses (3). Human-to-human transmission of NoV occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, with the small intestine being the initial site of viral replication (1,4). The lack of an efficient cell culture system in which to study NoV infections has hindered development of antiviral drugs to control or limit NoV outbreaks (5). Currently, animal models are being used to increase our understanding","Abstract: Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide.

While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.

For decades, the health risks associated with space exploration have been increasingly documented and characterized. For some of these risks, countermeasures have been sufficiently developed to sustain human health in low-Earth orbit, the orbital distance from Earth that includes the International Space Station (ISS).

For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light.

This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.

Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.

Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5. Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

This study evaluated C57BL/6 mice on Day 40 after total-body 56Fe26+ irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the white blood cell (WBC) count or major leukocyte types. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.

While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight.

Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (μ g) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.Keywords: transcriptional profiling, adaptation to spaceflight, Arabidopsis, microgravity (μg), plants Edited by: Francisco Javier Medina, Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Spain Reviewed by: Patrick H.

A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible neurotransmission modulator, was observed.Conclusions/Significance Upregulation of statocyst function in snails following microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to adapt to gravity changes. This simple animal model offers the possibility to describe general subcellular mechanisms of nervous system's response to conditions on Earth and in space. * E-mail: balaban@ihna.msk.ru (PMB); richard.boyle@nasa.gov (RB) Conceived and designed the experiments: PMB AYM VNI NA NIB ISZ RB.

Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO32- (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca2+ (log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space.

Each working electrode (WE) is 240 μm in diameter and is equally spaced at 1.4 mm from the REs, which are 480 μm in diameter. These electrodes are connected to electrical contact pads with a dimension of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The schematic is shown in Figure 2.

In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.

Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling.

Brassinosteroids (BRs) lead to ectopic activation of quiescent centre division as well as modulation of the columella stem cells differentiation in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner. Key words: Auxin, brassinosteroid, BZR1, columella stem cell, PINs, quiescent centre (QC), root apical meristem, root development. Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner. The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a ‘stem cell niche’ (SCN) (Supplementary Figure S1 available at JXB online; Bennett and Scheres, 2010).

Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress. Temperatures above the optimum are sensed as heat stress (HS)1 by all living organisms. When exposed to high temperature, plants have sophisticated mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis and minimize cell damage. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) mediate gene expression changes leading to the production of hea","Abstract: To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of Arabid | DISCUSSION: The heat-induced rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt is considered to be an essential step in plant responses to heat stress.

Received 2018 Jun 11; Accepted 2018 Jul 4; Issue date 2018 Sep. ANN1 and ANN2 regulate Arabidopsis primary root growth by facilitating post-phloem transport of sugar in root tips. Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants. Annexins are multifunctional proteins that have been found in all plants and vertebrate species. Their tertiary structure with calcium-binding domains is evolutionarily conserved in all species (Morgan et al., 2004, 2006; Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2012).

This is particularly true in the athletic population. Athletes are frequently confronted with complicating factors both internal and external that make traditional progressive loading methods problematic or counterproductive. These include underlying concomitant conditions, chronic orthopaedic issues, acute tissue healing timelines, or even previous acute workloads that can create situations where they lack the structural and functional tolerance for an intensification in loading during training and rehabilitation.

PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain.

Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.

Human society faces an acceleration of water scarcity due to increasing population, pollution, and land use. Such water scarcity also brings a decrease in water quality, as demonstrated by increased eutrophication, among other concerns (1). Treatment and reuse of water are critical tools in combating water stress globally. Reuse of wastewater carries the potential risk of transmission of small-molecule metabolites and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (2), while its use relieves stress on natural sources of water. Previously, biofilms were sampled from the Orange County Water District (OCWD) Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) in Southern California, which showed differences in the microbial communities in both influent and biofilms on microfiltration and reverse osmosis membranes (3). In a recent study that more fully characterized both biofilms and large volumes of water throughout the treatment process, we described both microbial diversity and load decreasing across this well-engineered system (4). Here, we have expanded and enhanced this previous work (4) by identifying metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that contain ARGs to expand our knowledge of all microbial lineages harboring ARGs that are present within an ultrapurified water facility. Water and biofilm were sampled at the OCWD AWPF as previously described (4).

Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.Keywords: pre-earthquake phenomena, positive holes, ULF (ultralow frequency) waves, ELF (extremely low frequency) waves, air ionization, water oxidation, hydrogen peroxide, physiological effects Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; E-Mail: Friedemann.T.Freund@nasa.gov.

Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue.

However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation.Conclusions These observations shed light on the specific environmental factors that contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight with important implications for mammalian metabolism.

Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter.

At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.

Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.

Mice are facultative daily heterotherms and, in contrast to humans who maintain a near constant core body temperature over a wide range of environmental temperatures, mice can experience dramatic transient reductions in core temperature (torpor) when exposed to temperatures below thermoneutral1,2. Because of their small mass, mice are much more dependent on shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis for maintaining core body temperature than larger animals3. The recommended temperature for housing mice in a laboratory setting (20–26 °C) is well below their thermoneutral zone, which depending upon strain, sex and age typically ranges from 29–31 °C4. Subthermoneutral housing induces adaptive responses in mice to increase generation of heat5. These adaptations include shivering thermogenesis, non-shivering thermogenesis, thermic effect of increased food consumption and physical activity.

Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo. We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons. Our data reveal that spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop adequate countermeasures for safe space exploration.

Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.

Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.KEYWORDS: nutritional supplements, flux balance analysis, genome-scale metabolic models, Caenorhabditis elegans, Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, serine Address correspondence to Christoph Kaleta, c.kaleta@iem.uni-kiel.de Address correspondence to Hinrich Schulenburg, hschulenburg@zoologie.uni-kiel.de Georgios Marinos and Inga K.

A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment.Results Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site.Conclusions The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-015-0116-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: International Space Station, Air, Surface, Microbiome, Closed habitat, Cleanroom, Propidium monoazide Received 2015 Jul 28; Accepted 2015 Sep 28; Collection date 2015.

Draft genome sequences of Aspergillus fumigatus strains (ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4), opportunistic pathogens isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), were assembled to facilitate investigations of the nature of the virulence characteristics of the ISS strains to other clinical strains isolated on Earth. Fungi are a source of natural products that are useful to humankind. A variety of bioactive compounds produced by fungi are used in pharmaceutical and food industries, agriculture, and beyond. However, some fungi are plant, animal, and human pathogens. Fungal pathogens could cause serious health complications in immunocompromised populations. Pathogenic fungi can produce a range of secondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (melanins, siderophores, species-specific toxins) and immunologic potential. Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic, filamentous fungus that is ubiquitous outdoors (soil, decaying vegetation) and indoors (hospitals, simulated closed habitats, etc.). Aspergillus fumigatus can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g., noninvasive and invasive pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, etc.) in immunocompromised hosts. In on-going microbial observatory experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), molecular phylogeny and radiation resistance of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated from a HEPA filter (1) and cupola wall (unpublished) of the ISS. Because A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen causing pathologies ranging from allergic asthma to invasive aspergillosis, we assessed several pathogenic characteristics of the ISS isolates in comparison to two experimentally established clinical isolates, Af293 (2) and CEA10 (3). Virulence assessment in a larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 as significantly more lethal compared to both clinical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) (4). In addition, the ISS strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 exhibited significantly greater resistance to UV254 doses when compared to clinical isolates (4, 5). The genomics of these ISS isolates might reveal the molecular mechanisms of the increased virulence. Subsequently, if the enhanced virulence is attributed to the microgravity,","Abstract: Draft genome sequences of Aspergillus fumigatus strains (ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4), opportunistic pathogens isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), were assembled to facilitate investigatio | GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT: Fungi are a source of natural products that are useful to humankind.

The draft genome sequences of 20 biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) opportunistic pathogens isolated from the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) were presented. These genomic sequences will help in understanding the influence of microgravity on the pathogenicity and virulence of these strains when compared with Earth strains. In an on-going Microbial Observatory experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), multiple biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) bacterial isolates were isolated, identified, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. The genomic data enables the determination of the microgravity influence on pathogenicity and virulence in these microorganisms by comparison to type strains of the corresponding species. Acinetobacter pittii is a nonmotile coccobacilli isolated for the first time from cerebrospinal fluid (1). Multiple strains of A. pitti were isolated from the cupola area. The IIF1SW-P1 was resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, penicillin, and rifampin. Two multidrug-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates were found in the waste and hygiene compartment (WHC) location. Species of Enterobacter cloacae complex (Ecc) are commonly found in the environment, but are of high clinical significance (2). Pantoea conspicua was originally isolated from human blood (3). This was the second most prevalent species, and was only found in one location during two different flight samplings. P. conspicua isolates were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin, and rifampin. Staphylococcus isolates were the most prevalent from ISS surfaces. Staphylococcus aureus was the most abundant in all ISS locations. Although this species is a common human commensal (4), it causes various types of minor skin infections, bacteremia, or scalded skin syndrome, especially in immunocompromised individuals (5). In this study, some of the isolates were found to be resistant to erythromycin (IF4SW-P1, IF7SW-P3) and most of the isolates were resistant to penicillin. A few isolates acquired rifampin resistance during the study (RA isolates). Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis belong to coagulase-negative staphylococci (6, 7). S. hominis IIF4SC-B9 was resistant to penicillin and erythromycin, but S. haemolyticus IIF2SW-P5 was susceptible to these antibiotics.

The whole-genome sequences of eight fungal strains that were selected for exposure to microgravity at the International Space Station are presented here. These baseline sequences will help to understand the observed production of novel bioactive compounds. In a screening project of natural products, fungal strains isolated from environments associated with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident (1) have been investigated. The radiation-tolerant microorganisms selected for exposure to microgravity at the International Space Station were known to produce valuable natural products; their genomic sequences coded for secondary metabolism pathways; or they displayed positive radiotropism. Aspergillus niger, an industrially important filamentous fungus, contains a sequence resembling the fumonisin gene cluster, which suggests that the fungus has the genetic potential to produce carcinogenic fumonisins (2). A. niger also produces an abundance of naphtho-gamma-pyrone secondary metabolites, which have been shown to have antibacterial, antifungal (3), antitumor (4), and cytotoxic (3, 4) activity. Aspergillus terreus is used to produce organic acids, such as itaconic acid (5), or enzymes, such as xylanases (6, 7). One of the most important secondary metabolites made by A. terreus is the cholesterol-lowering molecule lovastatin. Discovery of this potent compound revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (8, 9). Aureobasidium pullulans is an important producer of pullulan, a homopolysaccharide of glucose that is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and electronics industries (10, 11). The whole-genome sequence of A. pullulans revealed significant biotechnological potential but also the presence of virulence factors that cannot be overlooked (12). Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungus used to produce biodegradable, nonpoisonous, and cost-efficient bioinsecticides (13). Genomic analysis of B. bassiana exhibits its capacity to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites, such as oosporein, bassianin, beauvericin, or oxalic acid (14). Beauvericin possesses antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, and antitumor activity (15). Cladosporium cladosporioides, a ubiquitous organism, produces cladosporin and isocladosporin—secondary metabolites known to have antifungal activities. Its genome has not been sequenced yet (16, 17).

The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time.

Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time.Conclusions The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants.

While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems.

The draft genome sequences of six Bacillus strains, isolated from the International Space Station and belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group, are presented here. These strains were isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module (one strain), U.S. Harmony Node 2 (three strains), and Russian Segment Zvezda Module (two strains). Among the six Bacillus cereus sensu lato strains reported here, three U.S. Harmony Node 2 isolates (ISSFR-3F, ISSFR-9F, and ISSFT-23F) and one Japanese Experiment Module isolate (JEM-2) were sequenced and assembled with both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII sequence data. The remaining assemblies, including two Russian isolates, were sequenced and assembled with only MiSeq data. The MiSeq runs yielded on average 24 to 54 million 300-bp reads (from 1,402× to 3,093× average coverage), while PacBio yielded 4,000 to 116,000 reads (from 7× to 202× average coverage) (Table 1). Due to the extremely high coverage (>1,000×), Illumina MiSeq reads were randomly down-sampled to 100× using an estimated genome size of 5.3 Mb, resulting in an average of 1.2 to 1.5 million paired-end reads per isolate. Next, the down-sampled reads were assembled using iMetAMOS (1) with IDBA_UD and SPAdes (2). IDBA_UD was selected as the best assembly for all six isolates. Low confidence bases within the selected IDBA_UD (3) assemblies were masked out by mapping all reads to the assembled contigs and detecting conflicting variants with FreeBayes (4). The PacBio reads were assembled following the methods described by Berlin et al. (5) with Celera Assembler version 8.3rc1 and polished with Quiver (6). A second round of polishing was performed post-Quiver using the available MiSeq data as input to Pilon (7).

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Here, we present the draft whole-genome sequence of a clinical isolate of Fusarium fujikuroi cultured from a patient undergoing chemotherapy for refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Fusarium was first discovered in 1958, and while notorious for causing the devastating disease it causes in plants and crops, it is now recognized as an emerging global opportunistic human pathogen causing numerous cases of fusariosis every year (1, 2). While roughly 80% of the human cases of fusariosis are caused by members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, there are many infections attributed to the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Here, we report the draft whole-genome sequence of F. fujikuroi strain COH1152, which was isolated from a 68-year-old male with refractory acute myeloid leukemia. While undergoing chemotherapy, he developed a large lesion on his left leg after sustaining minor trauma, followed by neutropenic fever and multiple small painful nodules on his face, abdomen, and thighs. The biopsy sample of the left thigh skin lesion showed invasive hyphal elements, and a Fusarium sp., as identified by morphology, was isolated from both blood and tissue cultures. A Fusarium isolate, cultured from the blood and denoted COH1152, was sent for whole-genome sequencing and identified as the species F. fujikuroi. The COH1152 genome was paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size, resulting in a total of 41 million reads (GC content, 47.5%). Trimmomatic, on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org), was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings, max mismatch = 2, how accurate the match between the two “adaptor ligated” reads = 30, and how accurate the match between any adaptor = 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (setting, minimum quality required to keep a base = 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled with ABySS version 2.0.2 (3), using a k-mer size of 88. The COH1152 genome assembly resulted in a genome size of 48 Mb, with an N50 value of 1,212,708 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 4,495, with a max scaffold length of 6,034,165 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 501. A second clinical Fusarium isolate, COH1141, as identified by morphology, was cultured from another patient also receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia.

The draft genome sequence of this strain contains 3,809,180 bp with an estimated G+C content of 38.61%. Solibacillus is a novel microbial genus characterized in 2009 by Krishnamurthi et al., who reclassified Bacillus silvestris into the genus Solibacillus, making it the type species (1). The Solibacillus genus was described as comprising Bacillus-like organisms with Gram-positive, rod-shaped cells, and round endospores formed terminally in swollen sporangia. In 2016, Poonam et al. reclassified Bacillus isronensis into the genus Solibacillus and provided an emended description of the genus Solibacillus that showed the peptidoglycan type to be A4α-l Lys-d-Glu and the fatty acid profile to contain iso-C15:0, C16:1ω7c alcohol, and iso-C17:1ω7c, with MK-7 being the major menaquinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine being the major polar lipids (2). Until recently, there were two bacterial species in the genus Solibacillus (S. isronensis and S. silvestris), and draft genomes of both species have been completed (3, 4). In an ongoing microbiological survey from 2014 to 2017, a novel bacterial species was isolated from a high-energy particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter system aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The round spore-forming bacterium was described as Solibacillus kalamii (5), and here we present its draft genome. The HEPA filter was in service for 40 months on the ISS before being brought back to earth for further microbiological and molecular analyses (5). In this study, we characterize the draft whole-genome sequence of strain S. kalamii ISSFR-015 (NRRL 65388T = DSM 101595T), which provides insight on putative genes coding for superoxide dismutase, universal stress proteins, vancomycin resistance, copper resistance, hydrogen peroxide resistance, and arsenic resistance. This evidence is suggestive of the bacterium’s success in surviving the high-stress environment of the ISS and the harsh cleaning procedures during spacecraft assembly. S. kalamii strain ISSFR-015T was sequenced following a shotgun sequencing method using the Illumina MiSeq platform with a paired-end module.

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Here, we present the whole-genome sequences of two Fusarium oxysporum isolates cultured from infected Zinnia hybrida plants that were grown onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The Fusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops (1), but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans (2, 3). However, F. oxysporum, like other fungi, produces many bioactive compounds that are beneficial to humans (4, 5) and could be exploited for use in the pharmaceutical/medical industries. During the course of the “Veggie” project (a vegetable production system flown onboard the International Space Station [ISS] to study the effects of the space environment on plant growth and function), Zinnia hybrida plants became afflicted with a foliar, stem, and root rot disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Isolates were cultured from the leaf (VEG-01C1) and the root (VEG-01C2) of these infected plants, and the draft whole-genome sequences are described herein. The whole-genome sequences were paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size. A total of 33 million reads (GC content, 47.5%) and 46 million reads (GC content, 46.8%) were obtained from VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, respectively. Trimmomatic, on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org), was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings, max mismatch, 2; how accurate the match between the two adaptor ligated reads, 30; how accurate the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings, minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled with ABySS version 2.0.2 (6) using k-mer sizes of 80 (VEG-01C1) and 88 (VEG-01C2). The VEG-01C1 assembly resulted in a genome size of 49.3 Mb, with an N50 value of 376,797 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,455, with a max scaffold length of 1,817,733 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 588. The VEG-01C2 assembly resulted in a genome size of 48.9 Mb, with an N50 of 334,342 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,398, with a max scaffold length of 2,326,957 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 637. The assembled genomes were compared to those of 66 F. oxysporum isolates downloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/), as well as those of two isolates cultured from ISS environmental surfaces, using (i) 10 phylogenetically in","ABSTRACT: Here, we present the whole-genome sequences of two Fusarium oxysporum isolates cultured from infected Zinnia hybrida plants that were grown onboard the International Space Station (ISS). | GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT: The Fusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops (1), but can also cause opportuni | Accession number(s).: The assembled whole-genome sequences have been deposited in DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers PXUO00000000 (VEG-01C1) and PXUN00000000 (VEG-01C2).

The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains. KEYWORDS: Fusarium, International Space Station, fungi, genomics Two isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, were cultured from the dining table on the International Space Station (ISS). Genomic analyses using EF-1α sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study.

Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured.Conclusions The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation.

These WGS enable the identification of genes responsible for synthesizing compounds with biological implications. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa of phylum Basidiomycota is found in soil, air, food, stool, and other environments (1) and produces carotenoids, making it easily identifiable by its distinctive pink, yellow, orange, or red colonies (2). Carotenoids are important for various biological activities, including vitamin A biosynthesis, enhancement of the immune system, reduction of the risk of various diseases (3), and protection from radiation (4). For these reasons, R. mucilaginosa carotenoids are used as food additives and hold pharmaceutical potential (5). R. mucilaginosa, which was previously considered to be nonpathogenic, has now been classified as an emerging pathogen (6, 7) and has been shown to colonize central venous catheters, causing fungemia due to biofilm formation (8). Among the 28 recognized members of the genus Rhodotorula (9), R. mucilaginosa is the most common species isolated from the environment (7) and the most abundant yeast isolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) (10). The ability of this yeast to produce biofilms makes it very important to study ISS strains since the harsh conditions of the ISS (microgravity and radiation) were shown to enhance antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation (11, 12).

The whole-genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from the International Space Station were generated, and the strains were identified as being members of the order Enterobacteriales. Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment. Members of the order Enterobacteriales have been found to exhibit human pathogenicity and therefore pose a health risk for people on Earth and for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (1, 2). The latter is of concern for long-duration missions, as astronauts have been shown to be immunocompromised (3). Importantly, these bacteria are able to adapt to extreme conditions such as microgravity and radiation and thus persist, necessitating the development of appropriate countermeasures to control them. Members of the order Enterobacteriales that were found on ISS surfaces were Pantoea brenneri, Pantoea agglomerans, Kalamiella piersonii, and Enterobacter bugandensis (4–6). On Earth, P. agglomerans and P. brenneri were reported to have been isolated from human infections (4). K. piersonii is a member of a novel genus in the family Erwiniaceae that has exhibited resistance to multiple clinical drugs, such as penicillin and vancomycin, allowing it to be an emerging pathogen (5). E. bugandensis was documented from blood as a causative agent of septicemia in various geological locations (7). Analyses of draft genome assemblies for these species might pave the way to identify the genetic processes responsible for potential pathogenicity, as previously reported for some of these strains (5, 6).

The order Lactobacillales consists of Gram stain-positive, facultative anaerobes validly described by Ludwig et al. (1). Members of the genus Enterococcus are found to possess human pathogenicity characteristics such as antibiotic resistance (2) and therefore pose health concerns for those on Earth and astronauts residing in the International Space Station (ISS). However, Aerococcus urinaeequi, a nonpathogenic strain, was first isolated from horse urine (3). Astronauts on long flights are immunocompromised due to microgravity-induced physiological and mental stress. Decreased immune response allows bacteria to take growth advantage due to their adaptability potential in the space environment (4). Understanding the genomic makeup of these potential pathogens will help the development of suitable countermeasure and mitigation strategies. Members of the order Lactobacillales isolated from the ISS and the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) surfaces were Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Aerococcus urinaeequi (5, 6).

The whole-genome sequences will aid in comparative genomic studies of ISS Klebsiella strains with Earth counterparts to gain insight into their adaptation to space conditions. The genus Klebsiella was discovered by Carl Friedlander in 1882 from the lungs of patients who had died of pneumonia (1). In infected individuals, Klebsiella species can populate the gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, surviving on mucosal surfaces, and are known for being highly virulent and resistant to antibiotics (2, 3). When found on Earth, this genus of bacterial pathogens has various degrees of pathogenicity, which can lead to severe breathing problems necessitating a ventilator and rapid on-site treatment (4). When exposed to space conditions, however, Klebsiella species might become immunogenic and thus pose a risk to already immunocompromised astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (5, 6). Since microgravity and radiation in space are reported to induce multiple genetic adaptations in microbial species, such as structural modifications of the cell membrane, that can subsequently alter their virulence (5), the strains identified here might potentially pose a problem for the health of astronauts. Therefore, a genetic comparison is necessary to provide more details on the survival of Klebsiella species, which have gained more attention because classical Klebsiella pneumoniae and its hypervirulent pathotype are becoming increasingly resistant to various antibiotics, such as","ABSTRACT: Isolated across four locations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 10 bacterial strains were compared using whole-genome sequencing analysis and were phylogenetically identified as Klebsiell | ANNOUNCEMENT: The genus Klebsiella was discovered by Carl Friedlander in 1882 from the lungs of patients who had died of pneumonia (1).

The draft genome sequences of 29 bacterial isolates belonging to the family Bacillaceae were collected from the International Space Station, assembled, and identified. Further analysis of these sequences will enable us to understand their roles for space and biotechnological applications. The family Bacillaceae is composed of mostly aerobic or facultatively anaerobic rods with a Gram-positive cell wall. Members of this group are ubiquitous in nature, found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, and foods and in extreme environments with high temperatures (1). Bacillaceae groups are reported to produce a wide range of valuable and thermostable extracellular enzymes (2). The majority of Bacillaceae can form endospores that are crucial for survival in harsh environments (3, 4). This spore-forming property makes it important for NASA planetary protection purposes because spore-forming bacteria are more likely to survive sterilization procedures and the harsh environments of outer space, making them a potential threat for forward contamination (5). This report presents the draft genome sequences of three species (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, and Paenibacillus polymyxa) belonging to the family Bacillaceae, isolated from predefined surfaces at various locations on the International Space Station. The samples were collected using premoistened polyester wipes (6), brought back to Earth, aseptically transferred to a 500-ml bottle containing 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, mixed by vigorously shaking, and concentrated via a filtration system. An appropriate aliquot of each sample was inoculated onto either Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) (25°C; 7 days) or blood (37°C; 2 days) agar.

During an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), 30 strains representing seven species belonging to the Penicillium (n = 5) and Aspergillus (n = 2) genera were isolated (1), and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. The Penicillium genus encompasses more than 350 species found worldwide in soil, vegetation, air, indoor environments, and food (2). Aspergillus species are saprophytes found in a variety of environmental niches; however, some of them are also opportunistic human pathogens (3, 4). Members of the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera are of economic and industrial importance, including Penicillium chrysogenum, which is used to produce β-lactam antibiotics (5), Penicillium camemberti, which is used for maturation of soft cheeses such as Camembert, Brie, and Neufchatel (6), and Aspergillus niger, which is a known producer of citric acid (7, 8).

Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.

Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.

Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 103 CFU per 100 cm2, had R2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.

Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.

Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health. IMPORTANCE The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage.

In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense.

We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS.Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.

In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome.

We have demonstrated that spatial regulation of the same product from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity. In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of different secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous expression of all the A. terreus NRPS-like genes showed that two NRPS-like proteins, encoded by atmelA and apvA, release the same natural product, aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in different tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. Comparative genomics indicates that atmelA and apvA might share a same ancestral gene and the gene apvA is located in a highly conserved region in Aspergillus species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing distinct compounds with different functions. Our data also reveal that a single trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism gene clusters can modify more than one compound thereby expanding metabolite diversity. Our study raises the possibility of incorporation of spatial, cell-type specificity in expression of secondary metabolites of biological interest and provides new insight into designing and reconstituting their biosynthetic pathways. Filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus Aspergillus, are well known producers of secondary metabolites (SMs) with interesting biological activities. The genome sequencing of Aspergillus species revealed that the number of putative SM genes greatly exceeds the number of identified SMs, suggesting many novel types of SMs still remain to be discovered.1 In general, these SM genes are clustered in the genome.2 A typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton.

Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, is discussed in depth. Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth. Filamentous fungi, including those within the Aspergillus genus, are known to produce a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs) that exhibit a broad range of biological activities. SMs are organic small molecules that confer selective advantage to the organism despite not being directly required for survival. In nature, SMs function as weapons to eliminate neighboring competition, chemical signals in microbial cell communication, agents of symbiosis and transportation, sexual hormones, or differentiation effectors.1 However, SMs also possess various characteristics that make them great drug candidates, which has resulted in their extensive use in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, they exhibit enormous structural and chemical diversity due to the enzymatic nature of their biosynthesis, in which the core backbone of the SM is often biosynthesized by either a polyketide synthase (PKS), which can be either non-reducing (NR-PKS) or highly-reducing (HR-PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a PKS–NRPS hybrid, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS), or a terpene cy","Abstract: Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates.

Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.

Atrophy of skeletal elements has long been identified as a hazard for the success of long-duration missions and astronaut quality of life1. US astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) exhibit loss of bone density when comparing pre- and post-flight DXA scan measurements2,3. Bone density reduction for a Mars mission has been estimated of up to 36%4. Recovery from bone degradation appears to be incomplete5,6. The role of the kidneys in skeletal homeostasis is complex. Recent research interest includes the interplay between αKlotho and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23)7. Alpha Klotho is secreted predominantly in the kidneys, whereas FGF23 is secreted by osteocytes8. FGF23 binds to αKlotho, and increases urine phosphorous excretion9. Both are required, as seen in mice that demonstrate phosphate retention if either component is deficient10. FGF23 also increases calcium reabsorption7. Through these mechanisms, FGF23 eliminates excess phosphorus and increases plasma calcium, with subsequent decreased calcitriol synthesis","Abstract: Alpha(α)Klotho, a soluble transmembrane protein, facilitates calcium-phosphorus homeostasis through feedback between bone and kidney and is a potential systemic biomarker for bone-kidney health during | Introduction: Atrophy of skeletal elements has long been identified as a hazard for the success of long-duration missions and astronaut quality of life1.

Patterns of tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription.Conclusions The datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What’s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.Keywords: Gravity, Spaceflight, Arabidopsis, Gravitropism, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Phosphorylation, Post-transcriptional gene regulation, Plastid Received 2020 Jan 7; Accepted 2020 Apr 12; Collection date 2020.

As part of our studies on long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. The isolate was determined as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly. Widely used for drinking water, membrane filtration systems face biofouling due to microbe accumulation and biofilm formation. Studies reveal Sphingomonadaceae as common initial colonizers, persisting dominantly during biofilm growth (1 – 4). Here, we report the genome sequence of a prevalent isolate. Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 was isolated from a biofilm on a Nadir MP005 microfiltration membrane used for drinking water biofouling studies (1, 5). Sph5 was previously reported to be phylogenetically closest to Sphingomonas sanguinis strains BAB-7166 (99%) and NBRC 13937 (99%) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and cultivation methods (1). However, the whole genome sequence (WGS) was not reported. WGS analysis is critical to uncover strain-specific traits associated with membrane biofouling. Here, we report the WGS of Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 using Illumina short-read sequencing and de novo assembly methods. We received the Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 water isolate from Wetsus, Netherlands. Single isolated colonies were obtained on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A, Teknova R0005; Difco 214530) and cultured in R2A broth at room temperature.

MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.

CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.

MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis.

Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, a","Abstract: The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health.

Plants were essential to the early evolution of terrestrial life and colonization of the young Earth (Kapoor et al., 2023). Plant communities continue to colonize and transform our planet including the newest ecosystems formed post-glaciation, restoring those degraded by human activities and adapting to changing ecological conditions (Huston and Smith, 1987; Chapin et al., 1994; Yuan et al., 2020; Heim et al., 2021). Plants cannot move away from a harmful stimulus, and thus, have evolved remarkable strategies to survive and eventually thrive in harsh environments. Today, humanity is on the verge of exploring our solar system and beyond, eager to discover, answer fundamental questions, and search for extraterrestrial forms of life. Undoubtedly, plants are key organisms to successful deep space missions and independence from the provision of terrestrial resources, whether for long duration interplanetary travel or establishing permanent settlements. We can employ terrestrial bio-design principles to mimic plant colonization on Earth and explore adaptations to novel ecosystems. This can be combined with precise molecular tools to enable long-term human space exploration. With this thought in mind, we have collated articles focusing on terrestrial plants from extreme environments and their adaptations to harsh conditions. This collective knowledge will advance the selection of desired plant characteristics relevant to human space missions and assist in the identification of valuable adaptive mechanisms that can be genetically engineered in targeted space food plants. Furthermore, terrestrial plants from the edge of habitability define limits for terrestrial forms of life and thus can direct efforts for the search for life beyond Earth (McKay, 2014; Huwe et al., 2019). In this Research Topic, De Micco et al. present an exhaustive review on the hazards of cosmic ionizing radiation to human exploration and discuss potential roles for plants in mitigating this Research Topic.

These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.

In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.
